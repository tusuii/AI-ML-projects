## Introduction
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing student performance information. The analysis provides insights into various factors that might influence student performance.

## Data
The dataset used for this project contains information about students' demographics, study habits, and performance. It's available in the [`data`](/data) directory.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Student-Performance-EDA.git
   cd Student-Performance-EDA
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the [`notebooks`](/notebooks) directory and open the `Student_Performance_EDA.ipynb` notebook.

3. Follow along with the code and comments to perform exploratory data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The notebook contains step-by-step EDA using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It covers tasks such as data cleaning, feature analysis, and statistical summaries.
